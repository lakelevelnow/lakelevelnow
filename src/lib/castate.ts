// State-level day-of-year comparison for lakelevelnow.com.
//
// A state page that ranks reservoirs by percent full is answering the wrong question.
// Percent full compares a lake to its own concrete rim; it says nothing about whether
// today is unusual. San Luis sits at 57% full and is still higher than 78% of August 13ths
// in its record, because a pumped-storage reservoir is drawn down every summer by design.
// Pine Flat sits at 22% full and is at its 37th percentile for the date — low, but not the
// outlier the percent-full column implies. The two orderings genuinely disagree, and that
// disagreement is the only thing on this site the state reservoir tables do not already print.
//
// This module computes that comparison once, at build time, from the same quantile ladder
// (`src/data/almanac-doy.json`) and the same live readings (`src/data/levels.json`) the lake
// pages use, so a state page can never quote a number that contradicts the lake page it
// links to. Every figure here is derived. Nothing is typed by hand, and a field that is
// absent upstream stays null rather than becoming a guess.
//
// Cost note: the ladder is ~830 KB and is imported through almanac.ts in Astro frontmatter.
// It is read at build time and never reaches a browser.
